# Course 2025–2026

Since 2025 I have been working as a **Technical Instructor** at EMT Granollers, teaching subjects related to mechanical design, manufacturing processes, industrial systems and product development.
My role combines **technical expertise**, **project‑based learning**, and **hands‑on workshop guidance**, helping students understand how engineering concepts translate into real industrial applications.

# Academic Year 2025–2026

Below is an overview of the subjects I teach, along with a brief description of the skills and concepts students develop in each module.

---

## 0) Workshop

The workshop is where I carry out the most hands‑on part of my work, dealing daily with **three‑phase industrial machines** and their power and control systems. My main responsibility is to ensure that all machines used by the students operate safely and reliably, solving real issues that appear due to their intensive use.

A large part of my work focuses on **three‑phase power supply**, verifying the correct connection of the three phases, checking protections, ensuring continuity, and confirming that power circuits behave as expected. I also work on the **control logic**, diagnosing and manipulating **contactors, relays, push buttons, limit switches, fuses, and start/stop systems**, both manual and automatic.

A significant portion of my role involves **fault detection and troubleshooting**. Many issues are caused by worn cables, loose terminals, damaged connectors, or incorrect manipulation by students. These situations have allowed me to develop strong skills in:

- Electrical and mechanical diagnostics
- Reading and interpreting industrial schematics
- Verifying power and control circuits
- Performing quick, safe and effective repairs

This experience has given me a very realistic understanding of industrial maintenance and machine behaviour in an educational environment, where student errors create a wide variety of real‑world problems. It has taught me to work with precision, safety and efficiency, while also guiding students in good practices and proper diagnostic methods.

## 1) Manufacturing Project

Students learn how to plan, organize and execute a complete manufacturing project.
The module covers:

- Process planning
- Material selection
- Machining and fabrication techniques
- Quality control and tolerances
- Documentation and project delivery

The goal is to simulate a real industrial workflow from concept to final part.

---

## 2) Mechanical Product Design Project

This subject introduces students to the fundamentals of **mechanical design**, focusing on:

- CAD modelling
- Functional design criteria
- Assembly design
- Design for manufacturing (DFM)
- Prototyping and validation

Students develop a complete mechanical product from initial idea to digital prototype.

---

## 3) Graphic Representation & Interpretation

A module dedicated to understanding and producing technical drawings:

- Orthographic views
- Sections and dimensions
- Standardized symbols
- Reading and interpreting industrial blueprints

This subject builds the foundation for communication in engineering environments.

---

## 4) Water Network Project

Students design a complete water distribution system, learning:

- Basic hydraulics
- Pipe sizing
- Pressure calculations
- Network layout
- Technical documentation

The project simulates real civil and industrial water installations.

---

## 5) Tooling Design (Disseny d’útils)

This module focuses on designing tools and fixtures used in manufacturing:

- Positioning and clamping systems
- Jigs and fixtures
- Ergonomics and safety
- Optimization for production

Students create tooling solutions for real manufacturing scenarios.

---

## 6) Polymer Mold Design

An introduction to the design of molds for polymer products:

- Injection molding fundamentals
- Mold components
- Cooling systems
- Material behavior
- CAD modelling of mold assemblies

This subject connects product design with industrial production processes.
