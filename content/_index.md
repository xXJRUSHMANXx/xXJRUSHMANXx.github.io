# Alexander Sakhnov
**Mechanical & Electronic Engineer**

I am an engineer driven by curiosity, creativity and a strong desire to build real, functional solutions.
My background combines **Mechanical Engineering**, **Electronic Engineering**, **Additive Manufacturing**, and **Industrial Automation**, allowing me to approach problems from both a technical and practical perspective.

Over the years, I have worked with a wide range of technologies:
from **3D printing with clay, concrete, FDM and SLA**, to **robotics**, **renewable energy systems**, **CAD design**, and **AI‑assisted workflows**.
I enjoy designing, prototyping and improving systems that connect the digital and physical world.
