# Alexander Sakhnov
**Mechanical & Electronic Engineer | Additive Manufacturing | CAD | AI for Industry**

I am an engineer passionate about technology, problem‑solving and hands‑on innovation.
My background combines **Mechanical Engineering**, **Electronic Engineering**, **3D printing**, and **industrial automation**, allowing me to design, build and optimize real solutions from scratch.

I enjoy working on projects that mix creativity and engineering:
from **renewable energy systems** and **industrial robotics**, to **additive manufacturing with clay and concrete**, and **AI‑assisted design workflows**.

This portfolio showcases the projects, experiences and studies that have shaped my technical journey.
