# About Me

I am an engineer driven by curiosity, creativity and a genuine passion for building things that work.
My background combines mechanical engineering, electronics, automation, additive manufacturing and artificial intelligence — a mix that reflects how I naturally approach problems: from multiple angles, always looking for the most efficient and elegant solution.

Beyond the technical side, I value communication, teamwork and adaptability.
I have worked in multicultural environments, supported international clients, and handled customer‑facing roles that strengthened my ability to listen, understand and respond with clarity and empathy.

I enjoy learning, experimenting and improving. Whether I am designing a mechanical system, troubleshooting an electrical installation, teaching students or developing an AI model, I approach every challenge with the same mindset: **solve, improve, and keep moving forward**.

Outside engineering, I appreciate simple things: good conversations, discovering new ideas, and staying active.
I like to think of myself as someone who is always growing — both professionally and personally.
