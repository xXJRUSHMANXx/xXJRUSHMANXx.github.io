# 3Deseos – Custom 3D Design & Problem Solving

3Deseos is a personal project where I combine my skills in **SolidWorks design**, my extensive experience in **additive manufacturing**, and my natural mindset for **problem‑solving** to create custom solutions for all kinds of needs.

Over the years, I have helped people with **functional parts, decorative pieces, personalized gifts, and practical everyday solutions**, always adapting each design to the user’s specific requirements.

## 🔧 Custom Functional Supports

One of the most common requests I receive is the creation of **custom supports** for objects that don’t have a commercial solution.

Some examples include:

- a tailored support for a **lantern** in a backyard
- holders and organizers for everyday household items
- adapters, clips and brackets designed to fit perfectly in a specific environment

Each part is designed from scratch in SolidWorks and optimized for 3D printing to ensure strength, usability and a perfect fit.

## 🎨 Personalized Decorative Designs

I also create **fully customized decorative pieces**, combining engineering precision with artistic creativity.

A notable example is a project for a **golf professional**, where I designed a miniature model of a golf terrain, complete with a flag and the client’s name.
These pieces are unique, meaningful and tailored to the person who receives them.

## 🖨️ 3D Printing Service

Besides designing, I also offer **3D printing services** for clients who already have their own models.
I help them choose the right material, optimize the print, and ensure the final piece meets the required quality and functionality.

## ♻️ Bringing Public Designs to Life

Whenever I find **useful or interesting public designs**, whether decorative or functional, I print them, improve them if needed, and adapt them to real‑world use.
This allows me to bring open‑source ideas to life and make them accessible to people who need them.
